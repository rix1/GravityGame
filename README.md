# GravityGame

This game is really simple:

1. You and your avatar have to find the exit (Spoiler alert: marked with pink) while digging to the music.
2. Dig some more to the music and watch your score increase!

*(Hint: Exists a removable tile that gives you even more points!)*
 
### Controls

Walk your character around the map with the `up, down, left, right` keys on your keyboard. No jumping in this version!

### Game features

The game offers the following features:

- Scoring system
- Saving and loading games upon start/exit (this happens automatically!)
- Animated character! This includes a animation graph, so that future animations can be added swiftly!
	- Next version will include more animations (jump maybe???)
- Different blocks! (some can be picked up, while other are solid). In the future, generating new blocks will even be super easy thanks to object orientation! WO!
	- In the next version some will even chase you!
- Background music

### AI

There is no AI in this version, as I understood this would be the main focus for the next assignment. Stay tuned!
